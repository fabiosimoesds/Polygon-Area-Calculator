# Polygon-Area-Calculator
FreeCodeCamp challenge - https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/scientific-computing-with-python-projects/polygon-area-calculator
In this project I used object oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class is a subclass of Rectangle and inherit methods and attributes.
